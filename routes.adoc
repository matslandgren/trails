== Background
I do a lot of hiking, especially in weird places where there is no infrastructure for walkers (marked trails, signboards, tourist maps, etc). This requires a lot of planning. For this purpose I have created a link:http://www.karpaterna.se/trailexplorer[map tool] where I can draw paths on top of various maps and GPS tracks. The tool will then calculate the distance along these paths, the elevation gain/loss and an approximate hiking time. (I use a formula known as link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_hiking_function[Tobler's hiking function] to calculate the hiking time.)

I would like to set up a database of waypoints that are connected by a network of trails. When I want to go hiking somewhere, I could ask the database what route I should choose if I want to find the fastest way between two waypoints. If I have bad knees, I could ask for the route with the minimum amount of downhill walking. The more properties I can add to the waypoints and trails, the more possibilities I would have for finding routes based on diffetent criteria.

=== Graph Population 
This example sets up a very small database of waypoints connected by trails. If I created this project for real, the database could grow to thousands of waypoints and trails.

== The Next Step <<TOP, ^Top^>>
In order to calculate a route between two waypoints, for instance from Röstånga to Skäralid, I would need some formulas and express them in Cypher. I did find link:http://gist.neo4j.org/?8635758[this example] on your website which performs similar actions. However, I didn't manage to learn enough Cypher to perform something similar for my database. The example below just illustrates what I am hoping to achieve.

 Could you give me some hint on how to write the query below, please? :)

==== What is the shortest route from Röstånga to Skäralid?

----
MATCH p=shortestPath((a:Location)-[trail.km*]->(b:Location))
WHERE a.name = 'Röstånga'
AND b.name = 'Skäralid'
RETURN p AS route
